PROJECT TITLE: TIC TAC TOE game in python.

OVERVIEW: A simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game utilizes Python functions, lists, and interactive input, allowing two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The game continues until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

FEATURES: • Interactive gameplay for two players ('X' and 'O') • Dynamic 3x3 board display • Input validation to prevent illegal moves • Win and draw detection after every move • Clear game-end messages • Self-contained source code; no external libraries required

TECHNOLOGIES USED: • Python (built-in data structures and functions) • Console Input/Output • No third-party dependencies

STEPS TO INSTALL AND RUN:

Download or copy the Python script into a local file, e.g., tic_tac_toe.py.
Make sure Python (3.13) is installed on your system.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing tic_tac_toe.py.
Run the game using: python tic_tac_toe.py
INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING: • When prompted, enter your moves by specifying row and column numbers separated by a space (e.g., 1 2). • Only positions labelled with a blank space can be chosen. • The game validates each move and will prompt again if the input is invalid. • After a win or draw, the game exits automatically.
